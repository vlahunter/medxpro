# MedX Pro

## Description

MedX Pro is a HIPAA-compliant, multitenant Patient Management System designed to streamline healthcare operations for clinics, practices, and healthcare organizations. Built with modern technologies, MedX Pro provides a secure and efficient platform for managing patient records, scheduling appointments, handling prescriptions, integrating with external systems, and generating actionable insights.

## Features

### B2C (Patient-Facing - these might be exposed at a later phase)

- Patient Portal: View medical history, lab results, and appointments.
- Appointment Requests: Ability to request appointments online.
- Secure Messaging: Communicate with healthcare providers within the system.

### B2B (Medical Staff Facing)

- Patient Records: Comprehensive patient profiles with demographics, medical history, test results, and notes.
- Appointment Scheduling: Intuitive scheduling interface with resource and conflict management.
- Document Management: Secure upload, storage, and management of medical documents and images (integrated with Minio).
- Prescriptions: Integrated e-prescription generation and fulfillment tracking.
- Billing & Invoicing: Manage patient invoices, integrate with payment gateways, and track insurance claims.
- Reporting & Analytics: Customizable dashboards to track key practice metrics.
- HL7 Integration: Seamless exchange of patient data with other healthcare systems (FHIR-focused).

### Compliance, Specs, and Standards

- HIPAA Compliance (thorough analysis needed throughout development)
- FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources): Utilizing the current FHIR specifications for data exchange.
- HL7 v2 Support (as necessary, if dealing with legacy systems)

## Tech Stack

- Backend:
    - NestJS (TypeScript Framework)
    - PostgreSQL (Database)
    - TypeORM (Object Relational Mapper)
    - Minio (S3-compatible object storage)
    - NATS (High-performance messaging)
    - Passport.js (Authentication middleware)
    - HL7 Library (e.g., HAPI FHIR)
- Frontend:
   - TBD: React, Angular, or Vue.js (Choice at a later stage, API-first focus)
- Infrastructure
    - Docker & Docker Compose (Containerization)
    - CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- Additional (as needed):
    - Elasticsearch (Enhanced search)
    - ELK Stack (Logging - potentially replaced with a cloud logging solution in production)
    - Prometheus & Grafana (Monitoring)

## Development Path

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

- Project Initialization: NestJS project structure.
- Development Environment: Docker Compose configuration for app, database, storage, and messaging.
- Basic CI/CD: Build, test, and image creation pipeline.
- Authentication & Authorization: RBAC implementation.
- Database Schemas (Initial): Patients and appointments (simplified to start).

### Phase 2: Patient Module

- CRUD Operations: Implement core patient data management.
- Search: Basic patient search capabilities.
- API Documentation: Start documenting with Swagger/OpenAPI
- HL7 Research (Parallel): Familiarization with FHIR concepts and the chosen library.

### Phase 3: Functionality Expansion & HL7

- Appointment Scheduling: Implement a robust scheduling system.
- Document Management: Integration with Minio storage, security.
- HL7 Mapping: FHIR data mapping to your internal database models.

### Phase 4: Features & Refinement (Iterative)

- Prescriptions
- Billing & Invoicing
- Reporting & Analytics
- Advanced HL7 Capabilities
- Potential Frontend Development (if a standalone patient portal is desired)
